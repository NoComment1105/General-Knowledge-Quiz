If you wish to make contributions to my Github project please adhere to the following guidelines I'd like to set:

First though: THANK YOU so much for taking the time to contribute to my project!

1: Please be constructive with what you want to contribute It's better for everybody if you think before you post
2: Please use English for your contributions. It is the main language I'm fluent in. Eventually i hope to be fluent in German but that is some time away.
3: I am merely trying to have some fun with Python and learn more about it, please refrain from critisising me in an agressive way
4: Seeing as I am in full time education i may not be able to get into this project every day and as a result it may be a few days before any action is taken or your PR/issue

And finally, Thank you for contributing have a wonderful day!
